# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to practice basic HTML CSS and Javascript.
This project was built in order to posess a collection of information on the topics above on a single page. It solves the issue of information overload. This page cosolidates the massive amount of information into an easy to use study guide.
Through this process I learned the basic foundation of building a web page with the combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also learned how to use the terminal application as well as Git and GitHub. This also allowed me to practice a workflow between my local directories and GitHub.

## Usage

This guide can be used to review basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript concepts and terms.Each section has its own color to help with organiztion and association. DevTools through Google Chrome can also be used to see the JavaScript running. (To open DevTools, right click anywhere on the web page and select "inspect" then navigate to the "Console" tab.) When viewing the JavaScript a list of the main topics will be displayed as well as a random topic suggestion to start with. The page can be refreshed to change the randomly chosen topic in the DevTools, giving the act of reviewing some fun and uncertainty.
